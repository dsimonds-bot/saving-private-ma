### Getting Started

Welcome to Intro-to-Python! This course is intended for a brand new user, and will cover everything from downloading to basic data manipulation. My hope is that you'll pick up the basic fundamentals here, and use them to propel your Python forward :) Most importantly, however, this intro is intended to be completely open source. Feel free to take, copy, or fork anything contained here. If one can learn, maybe many can.

#### What is Python?
Python is a, "high level, object oriented" language. Essentially what this means is that is that it's great for beginners, quick and easy programming, and data analysis. Python differs from other languages in the fact that it is dynamic -- where other languages have to be compiled before running, Python is free from that constraint. 

Another selling point for Python is the community. Developers and data scientists alike publish free bunches of code called packages, which we'll explore a little later on. These allow users to circumvent large amounts of work, and provide tools not available in base versions of Python.  

#### Download Instructions
To get started as a beginner, I recommend downloading the Anaconda Distribution linked below. The best way to think about the Anaconda distribution is that it's a big ol' tool box for python containing the base program, and a bunch of over preinstalled tools. As you become more and more advanced, you can strip down anaconda for only the things you need, but for now, it's a good launching point. 

Follow the below link to download for Windows or Mac. Make sure NOT to install the miniconda, but rather the full version.

#### Using Python
One key benefit to Anaconda is that it comes with several flavors of IDEs. These are essentially softwares that offer a more streamlined user experience for Python. My personal favorite is Jupyterlab. Although there isn't a particular best IDE, most net-new beginners tend to gravitate towards Jupyter Notebook and Jupyterlab. 

If you decide to use either of these, some quick tips:
- Code exists in blocks called cells. What's great about an IDE like this is you can run certian blocks of code to isolate issues and/or functionality. 
- Shift + Enter is your best friend; it runs your current cell and creates a new one below it
- A kernel is essentially the engine that runs your code. Resetting it clears variables (memory) that you've set, while retaining your code. 
- Dark mode exists. Use dark mode. 
- Commenting in Python mainly centers around the hasthag # which will annotate everything to the right of it

And that's about it! I'm excited to share some very basic knowledge with you all, and hope it offers as a springboard into your Python career.
