### Intro to Variable Types

Objects and variables lay at the core of python. This means every script, variable, or process ultimately relies on and produces an object(s). These can come in many different shapes and forms, and will change depending on which tools we are leveraging. 

To kick us off, we'll focus on three really basic ones:
  - Strings
  - Integers
  - Floats

#### Strings
Python strings are used to store text and characters. For example:

  - 'hello'
  - 'world'
  - '10'
  
We make an object a string by putting either single or double quotation marks on either side. Put simple, "sample string" is the same as 'sample string'. 

#### Integers
For numeric objects, we may want to leverage integers. To make an integer, simple hit a number on your keyboard -- it's that easy! Some examples:

  - 4
  - 10
  - 104435
  
It is worth noting that you do not need to pass a comma for thousands places, and we can make negative ingeters simply by passing the hyphen (ex: -4).

#### Floats
Floats work pretty much exactly the same as integers, except we can leverage the decimal place. Some examples:

  - 4.1
  - 100.03
  - 3.14
  
#### Summary
In this section, we learned that there are many different types of variables in Python. Additionally, we kicked off with three basic types: strings, integers, and floats.
