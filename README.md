# Saving Private Ma
Quick repo to store Python code or data. Don't worry about storing all your code here. Only the stuff you eventually want me to take a look at. 

### Resources
In the root of this code base I created a folder called `lessons` which contains some code from when I was working on an intro to python course for something else. Feel free to take a peak in there. It's incredibly basic but maybe has some refreshers. 

### Pushing code from Google Colab
Google colab makes it pretty easy to push code into GitHub.
File > Save a Copy in GitHub > Choose appropriate repository > Choose appropriate file path.

For example, let's say I wanted to save a colab notebook `learning.ipynb` to the root of this directory. I'd do:
File > Save a Copy in GitHub > saving-private-ma > `learning.ipynb`. If we made a directory called `src` the above process would be near identical:

File > Save a Copy in GitHub > saving-private-ma > `src/learning.ipynb`. 

Note if you save to the same file path twice, it will override the original save. 

### Opening code from GitHub
Once you have files saved in Colab, you should be able to open GitHub and directly click through the link at the top to open the notebook again.
